    unRAID Community Applications I created because I didn't find them.
    I create these for personal use and share them for anyone else to enjoy.
    
    I provide support for them over at the unRAID Forums, where each CA gets its own thread, because reading or asking in a thread that's a lump of 10 containers is convoluted.
    
    Please keep in mind that whilst I will support setting these up for your scenario to the best of my abilities, I cannot provide the same level of support for the applications themselves, especially if you encountered a bug. If you do, I strongly recommend you go to the official bug tracker/other support outlet.
