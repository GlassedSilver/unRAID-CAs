# unRAID-CAs
unRAID Community Applications I created because I didn't find them.<br>
I create these for personal use and share them for anyone else to enjoy.

I provide support for them over at the unRAID Forums, where each CA gets its own<br>
thread, because reading or asking in a thread that's a lump of 10 containers is convoluted.

Please keep in mind that whilst I will support setting these up for your scenario to the<br>
best of my abilities, I cannot provide the same level of support for the applications<br>
themselves, especially if you encountered a bug. If you do, I strongly recommend you<br>
go to the official bug tracker/other support outlet. I will link both my thread and the<br>
official support in the table below.

## Directus
> An Instant App & API for your SQL Database.
> Directus wraps your new or existing SQL database with a realtime GraphQL+REST API for developers, and an intuitive admin app for non-technical users.
(description from the application's author)

It can be a headless CMS, your table viewer, UI/app builder for webapps and more to visualize, store and manage your SQL-stored data.
It's very a wrapper, doesn't mess with your data and doesn't lock you into a proprietary solution.
It's an interface, app, anything, but the backend can be detached at any time.
It lends itself very well to home users as well as advanced users and can handle file uploads and downloads.
