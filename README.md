# note to self: apps that need support link added in README and template: FMD2, manga-tagger

# unRAID-CAs
unRAID Community Applications I created because I didn't find them.<br>
I create these for personal use and share them for anyone else to enjoy.

I provide support for them over at the unRAID Forums, where each CA gets its own<br>
thread, because reading or asking in a thread that's a lump of 10 containers is convoluted.

Please keep in mind that whilst I will support setting these up for your scenario to the<br>
best of my abilities, I cannot provide the same level of support for the applications<br>
themselves, especially if you encountered a bug. If you do, I strongly recommend you<br>
go to the official bug tracker/other support outlet. I will link both my thread and the<br>
official #Support in the table below.

Directus
--------

> An Instant App & API for your SQL Database.
> Directus wraps your new or existing SQL database with a realtime GraphQL+REST API for developers, and an intuitive admin app for non-technical users.
(description from the application's author)

It can be a headless CMS, your table viewer, UI/app builder for webapps and more to visualize, store and manage your SQL-stored data.
It's very a wrapper, doesn't mess with your data and doesn't lock you into a proprietary solution.
It's an interface, app, anything, but the backend can be detached at any time.
It lends itself very well to home users as well as advanced users and can handle file uploads and downloads.

![FMD2-wine icon](/FMD2-wine/fmd2_logo-32x32.png?raw=true)
FMD2-wine (docker-fmd2)
-----------------------

> Dockerized FMD2 (Windows with Wine) using VNC, noVNC and webSocketify to display GUI on a webpage.

> This is an active fork of the Free Manga Downloader which is a free open source application written in Object Pascal for managing and downloading manga from various websites.
(description from the application's author and the container's maintainer respectively)

The application is in my experience a rock-solid way to download chapters for manga which are missing a license in your country yet and are free and legal to download. Some users use this application for more purposes as well, however I nor any of the authors of the application or the dockerfile endorse this usecase.

You're responsible for your own actions, so check whether you can download anything that's possible to scrape with this. Should go without saying, after all browser vendors don't need to disclaim themselves from the entirety that can be see on the web, but here we are...
