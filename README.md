# unRAID-CAs
unRAID Community Applications I created because I didn't find them.
I create these for personal use and share them for anyone else to enjoy.

I provide support for them over at the unRAID Forums, where each CA gets its own thread,
because reading or asking in a thread that's a lump of 10 containers is convoluted.

Please keep in mind that whilst I will support setting these up for your scenario to the
best of my abilities, I cannot provide the same level of support for the applications
themselves, especially if you encountered a bug. If you do, I strongly recommend you go to
the official bug tracker/other support outlet. I will link both my thread and the official
support in the table below.
