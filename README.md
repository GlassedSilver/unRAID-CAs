# unRAID-CAs
unRAID Community Applications I created because I didn't find them.<br>
I create these for personal use and share them for anyone else to enjoy.

I provide support for them over at the unRAID Forums, where each CA gets its own<br>
thread, because reading or asking in a thread that's a lump of 10 containers is convoluted.

Please keep in mind that whilst I will support setting these up for your scenario to the<br>
best of my abilities, I cannot provide the same level of support for the applications<br>
themselves, especially if you encountered a bug. If you do, I strongly recommend you<br>
go to the official bug tracker/other support outlet. I will link both my thread and the<br>
official support in the table below.
